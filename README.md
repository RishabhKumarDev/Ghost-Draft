# 👻 Ghost Draft

Ghost Draft is a **dark-themed blogging platform** built with React, featuring a clean, scalable architecture and a slightly spooky aesthetic. It allows authenticated users to **write, upload, and share blog posts** — complete with images and rich-text formatting.

This project was built with the purpose of **fully mastering React**, going beyond tutorials and implementing industry-level patterns in code structure, state management, and component design.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

At the time of building this app, I focused on:
- Learning React at a deep level, including custom components, services, and routing
- Structuring code in a scalable, maintainable way
- Integrating a Backend-as-a-Service (Appwrite) for auth and storage
- Deploying a real-world project and handling hosting challenges (like CORS)

## 🧩 Features

- 🧑‍💻 **User Authentication** (via Appwrite)
- 📝 **Rich Text Editor** (using TinyMCE)
- 🖼️ **Image Upload Support**
- 📁 **Well-Structured & Scalable Codebase**
- 🧠 **Global State Management** with Redux Toolkit
- 🎨 **Dark Theme** with Amber and White tones (Ghost aesthetic)
- ⚙️ **Custom Dynamic Components** (e.g. Button, Input, etc.)
- 🚀 **Fully Responsive UI** built with Tailwind CSS

## 🚧 What I Learned

- How to move beyond basic React tutorials into **real-world architecture**
- The importance of **component reusability and separation of concerns**
- Deploying full apps with BaaS and fixing real issues like **CORS errors**
- Thinking about **developer experience** as well as user experience

## 🚀 What's Next

I'm currently learning **Next.js** to explore SSR, file-based routing, and performance optimization — building on what I’ve mastered here with React.
